     <p>What you're looking at is my first properly put together <strong>HTML &amp; CSS</strong> combined project - which you are now viewing on a live URL!!! . It's pretty basic but every path leading forward starts with a simple step. Here's an unrelated list to gaze your peepers at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This is the first thing on my list</li>
        <li>The above list item was pointless</li>
        <li>Actually, none of these have a point... or do they?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Did I just blow your mind? Also, before I forget, here's a random <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness" target="_blank"><strong>link</strong></a> to a <strong>wikipedia page</strong>. <br /><br />Pretty neat, huh?<br /><br /><em class="foot-note"> Did you notice the picture is moving?</em>
